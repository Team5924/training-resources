### soldering iron

The soldering iron is used for soldering. The iron has different tips for different use cases. For most FRC use cases, a larger tip is ideal. The soldering iron will often be used for securing crimps after they've been crimped. A larger tip is ideal because of the greater surface area which allows heat to be applied faster and over a larger area.

Different crimpers are used for different connectors. Using the wrong crimper will create a poor connector. The most common crimpers we use are the ones for Anderson powerpoles.
