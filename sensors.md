# sensors

sensors allow for more complex software control and automation

## types of sensors

### rotary encoder

* measures angular position of a shaft
* can measure linear distance or speed

### gyro/imu

* measures rotational motion
* useful when you need to pose of robot

### potentiometer

* measures resistance
* used for position control 

### camera

* useful in vision system

### pixycam

* easy to use vision sensor
* returns blobs over serial
