The most popular motors in FRC are the cim, mini cim, bag, and 775pro. These motors are high rpm low torque, which means for most applications they will require to slow them down and/or increase torque. CIMs have been limited to 6 in previous years. The other motors have been allowed in unlimited quantities. cims are usually used in drivetrains with two or three to a side.
 
 
## 775pro vs cim
The cim and 775pro are roughly equivalent in power with the cim having 337w of power while the 775pro has 347w according to vex’s testing data. 775pro’s without gearing are about 3x faster than cims. Cims have greater thermal mass allowing them to be stalled for longer. The 775pro motor needs to be vented and monitored more carefully due to the lesser thermal mass. The 775pro is smaller and weighs significantly less than a cim.
