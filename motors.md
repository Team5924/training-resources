## frc legal motors
* cim
* mini cim
* bag
* 775pro
* others we don’t use
 
 
The most popular motors in FRC are the cim, mini cim, bag, and 775pro. These motors are high rpm low torque, which means for most applications they will require to slow them down and/or increase torque. The other motors have been allowed in unlimited quantities. cims are usually used in drivetrains with two or three to a side.
 
### cim
* have been limited to six in the past
* [andymark and vexpro cims are the same](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1642692&postcount=5)

### mini cim

* same form factor as cim except shorter

### 775pro

* 347w
* roughly equivalent power to a cim
* best size-power ration

### bag

* smallest in the list
 
## 775pro vs cim
The cim and 775pro are roughly equivalent in power with the cim having 337w of power while the 775pro has 347w according to vex’s testing data. 775pro’s without gearing are about 3x faster than cims. Cims have greater thermal mass allowing them to be stalled for longer. The 775pro motor needs to be vented and monitored more carefully due to the lesser thermal mass. The 775pro is smaller and weighs significantly less than a cim.

## denso throttle motor

the denso throttle motor is a motor that every team has a hundred of. they aren't the most useful or powerful but they're cheap. 

### redbox

team 4613 designed a cheap gearbox called the [redbox](http://www.team4613.org/redbox) that interfaces with the throttle motor. the gearbox is designed to be lasercut
