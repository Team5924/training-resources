# 3d printing
 
our main 3D printer is an Ultimaker 2+
 
## materials
We mainly use PLA and PETG. PLA is easy to print but not as resilient as PETG. PETG can be more difficult to print because it likes to stick aggressively to the bed and pull chunks out of the glass. It also has a narrower window for ideal settings than PLA. 
 
## slicer
Cura is the slicer we use. It can be [downloaded from Ultimaker’s website](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/cura-software). The [source](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) is availble on Ultimaker’s github.
 
## nozzle size
Different nozzle orifices are used for different purposes. For finer prints, use a smaller nozzle. Generally we use a 0.8mm nozzle for faster print times. Thicker layers will be stronger than thinner layers which is another advantage of using a larger nozzle. A good rule of thumb for max layer height with a given nozzle is 80% of the nozzle’s orifice. For example, a 0.8mm nozzle would have a max layer height of 0.64mm.
 
## getting started
* get a mesh file, probably from your cad software (stl is common)
* onshape export instructions
* import the file into cura
* select the appropriate settings
* put sliced gcode onto sd card with a memorable and descriptive name
* put sd card in ultimaker and print
 
## printers in the lab
### Ultimaker
#### maintenance

The Ultimaker requires occasional maintenance. Here are some things to check every once in awhile:
proper belt tension
linear rods are seated properly in housing
motion system is properly lubricated
bed is cleaned with alcohol or acetone
nozzle is clean
