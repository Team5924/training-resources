# laser

the laser is a good tool for making prototype and production robot parts quickly

our laser is an 80w trotec speedy 360

## materials

main materials that will be used for robot work

see [this article](http://atxhackerspace.org/wiki/Laser_Cutter_Materials) for more info about materials

### delrin

* good for production robot parts

### wood

* good for prototyping
* cheap

### polycarbonate

* doesn't cut particularly well

### abs
	
* good for production & prototype parts

### the never cut list
never cut these materials as they may cause damage to the laser or operator

* pvc
* vinyl
* fiberglass
* coated carbon fiber

## types of joints

special joints can be used when designing parts knowing that they will be manufactured by laser

## special features

### living hinge
the laser can be used to make a hinge when you need a part to bend

see [epilog's guide](https://www.epiloglaser.com/resources/sample-club/living-hinge-laser-cutting.htm) on living hinges
