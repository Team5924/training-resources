# precision machining


## machines

The mill and lathe are manual machines that allow us to create very precise parts. A manual machine is generally preferable to a cnc when a few or a single copy of a design is needed. 

The CNC is also a precision machine, but it is computer controlled. See the cnc page for more info.

## tools

### reamer

a reamer is used for making very precise holes. we usually use a reamer for making pressfits.

### twist drill

a twist drill is the type of drill bit that is commonly used in hand drills. 

### drill chuck

the drill chuck is used to hold drill bits

### end mill

end mills are used in the mill for most operations. they can face, bore, and do many more operations.

### parting tool

see parting operation

### parallels

parallels are metal blocks with precisely ground surfaces. they keep work clamped in a vise parallel and raised

### vise

the work is clamped in a vise or multiple vises. usually a long tube will be clamped with two or more vises. 

the vise contains known reference surfaces, such as the fixed jaw.

### indicator

an indicator is a precise measuring tool

## opeations

### facing

cutting a face onto the work

### drilling

drilling a hole

### parting
