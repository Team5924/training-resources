# cots
cots stands for "commercially off the shelf"

good designs effectively balance the use of cots and custom compenents

## common cots components

### versaframe

the versaframe product line contains parts for numerous different kinds of mechanism. the heart of the versaframe product line is the versaframe tubing which is predrilled 2"x1" or 1"x1" aluminum tubing in either 0.04" or 0.1" wall thickness. the 0.5" predrilled pattern is what makes the versaframe product so special. the holes are perfect for a 5/32" rivet or an 8-32 screw. versaframe gussets allow versaframe to be connected in a variety of ways easily. vex also provides parts to easily make custom drivetrains and linear motion systems.

### versaplanetary

the versaplanetary product line allows a planetary gearbox of a custom ratio to be made and interfaced with the common frc motors easily. 

### drive gearboxes

andymark, vexpro, and wcp all sell different drivetrain gearboxes. these gearboxes vary in areas such as amount of motors, single/double speed, shifting type (dog or ball), and reduction.

### thunderhex
