## fabrication methods

## different types of fasteners
 
### rivets vs screws
Rivets are useful when the other side of the material is inaccessible (that’s why they’re called blind rivets). We’ll often use a few rivets to constrain an assembly before we send it out to get welded. Screws are ideal for parts that may need to be removed or maintained. Typically we use ¼-20, 10-32, or 8-32 machine screws.

### aluminum box tubing
We most commonly use 2”x1” or 1”x1” aluminum box tubing with either 1/16” or ⅛” wall. Tubing is easily joined with gussets. 
 
### versaframe
Versaframe is like the aluminum tube above but with predrilled holes in 0.5” increments that are ideal for 5/32” rivets or 8-32 screws. Versaframe comes in thicknesses of 0.1” or 0.04”. One advantage to versaframe is the ecosystem of COTS parts vex sells, especially the versaframe gussets.
 
### aluminum sheet
We use 6061 aluminum sheet, often in ¼”, ⅛”, and 1/16”. 
 
### polycarbonate sheet
We use polycarbonate sheet (either clear or smoked) usually in ⅛” thickness. Polycarbonate is advantageous in many situations because it is easy to work with and more flexible than aluminum.
 
### delrin sheet
Delrin is a particularly useful material because it lasers well. We commonly use ¼”.
