# gears

## types of gear reduction

### spur gears

spur gears can be used to create custom gearboxes or they can be used in a cots gearbox. they are commonly seen in drivetrain gearboxes.

### bevel gears

bevel gears are useful in cases such as swerve when the motor packages better in an orientation where the driving shaft cannot be directly driven

### planetary gearbox

planetary gearboxes are most commonly seen in the versaplanetary gearbox. planetary gearboxes are particularly useful because they package well.

## balancing torque and speed

most FRC motors need to be slower, torquier, or both. gearing a motor down allows the high rpm low torque motors used in FRC to be used for a wide breadth of applications.
